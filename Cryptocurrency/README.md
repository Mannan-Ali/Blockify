# 🪙MannanCoin

This is a simple cryptocurrency blockchain implementation, allowing nodes to mine blocks, add transactions, and reward miners.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This blockchain simulates a cryptocurrency system with:

- Multiple nodes running on different ports (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5001`, `127.0.0.1:5002`).
- Each node has a unique node address generated using UUID4 function, which helps in distinguishing nodes and ensuring transactions are properly managed.
- This address is important because it ensures that each node can identify itself when adding transactions, mining blocks, and receiving rewards.

- Each node can send transactions, mine blocks, and reward miners with coins.
- Transaction rewards are given to the node that mines the block

---

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

- **Nodes**: Each node runs on a separate port and acts as a miner in the cryptocurrency network.

- **Transactions**: Users can send transactions from one address to another. Transactions are added to the node's mempool until they are included in a mined block.

- **Mining**: When a node mines a block, it includes all the transactions from its mempool. The mining node is rewarded with **MannanCoin** for validating and adding transactions to the blockchain.

- **Reward**: The node that mines the block receives a reward in **MannanCoin**, from the nodes address.

## 🔗 API Endpoints Added

### 1. **Add Transaction**

- **POST** `/add_transaction`
- Adds a new transaction to the blockchain.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "sender": "sender",
    "receiver": "receiver",
    "amount": "amount"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "This transaction will be added to block number {specific block}"
  }
  ```

### 2. **Connect Node**

- **POST** `/connect_node`
- Connects a new node to the blockchain network.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "nodes":{
      "address 1"
      "address 2"
      "..."
    }
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "All the nodes are connected and the number of nodes oon the blockchain are : ",
    "total-nodes": "number of nodes"
  }
  ```

### 4. **Replace Chain**

- **GET** `/replace_chain`
- Replaces the current blockchain with a longer valid chain if available from a connected node.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "chain": [],
    "length": "lenght of chain",
    "message": "message depending on True or False"
  }
  ```

## ⚙️ Setup Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Mannan-Ali/Blockify.git
```

Go to the **Cryptocurrency** folder:

```bash
  cd "Cryptocurrency"
```

Install the following:

```bash
  pip install flask==3.1.0 python-dotenv==1.0.1 requests==2.32.3 urllib3==2.2.3
```


Make n  different copy of the mannanCoin.py file and change the port numbers (Eg: 5000,5001,5002).

Run all the .py files in different bash/terminal window:

    ```bash
    python yourCopyFileNames.py
    ```

Now use Postman to interact with the different nodes to test API endpoints, send transactions, mine blocks, and validate the blockchain across all connected nodes.
