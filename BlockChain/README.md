## **Project Overview**
This sub-project highlights the successful creation of a custom blockchain from scratch, illustrating its essential components and practical implementation. It demonstrates the core principles of blockchain technology, including proof-of-work, hashing, and chain validation. 

### **🚀 Key Features:**
- **🌱 Genesis Block Creation**: The blockchain starts with a predefined genesis block.
- **⛏️ Mining Capability**: Implements proof-of-work to mine new blocks.
- **🔒 Chain Validation**: Ensures the integrity and validity of the blockchain.
- **🌐 Web API**: Provides endpoints for interaction, such as:
  - `/mine_block`: Mines a new block.
  - `/get_chain`: Retrieves the entire blockchain.
  - `/is_valid`: Checks if the blockchain is valid.
- **⚙️ Flask Integration**: Offers a seamless way to interact with the blockchain via Postman or other HTTP clients.
