as we will create an object of flask that will server as an web appliacation itself
we will use jsonify to returm messages using which we can interact with blockchain
also when a new block will be mined we will use it to jsonfiy to return the key information for this mined block

# Part 1 - Building a BlockChain

        genesis block
        we are calling the function here to create the genesis block, we are basically  making it with default parameters so genesisblock is automatically created
        prev_hash is in quotes becaouse we will use hashlib on it whcih take quoted values,
        By calling self.create_block(proof=1, prev_hash='0') inside __init__, you ensure that every blockchain starts with a genesis block, which is a foundational block and the starting point for any blockchain.
        why proof = 1?
        For the genesis block, thereâ€™s no prior block or need for complex calculations. Thus, it's common practice to set a simple, fixed proof value like 1.
        '''
        self.create_block(proof =1,prev_hash = '0')
        

# Part 2 - Mining our BlockChain

# function 1() To get a state of a blockChain

#function 2 () to mine new block
